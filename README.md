# FinalProject

May 23rd had to do major assignments and at the same time Start brainStorming on this one //
*May 24th Initial commit and Start of the Final Project -> Encounters soo many problems that perhaps my hair turned gray* //
I had issues with **redunduncy and errors and exceptions..** It is not the cleanest but nonetheless better (Classes and Enum ++) //
Tomorrow May 25th Brothers Birthday & after that I will have to come back home & check and update code for **Documentation & Unit Testing** if all goes well perhaps a final commit? //
Working on Final Project details, such as , Classes Documentation and Unit Testing before commiting
